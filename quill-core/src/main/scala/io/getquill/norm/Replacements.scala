/**
 * When doing beta reductions, the Opinions of AST elements need to be set to their
 * neutral positions.
 *
 * For example, the `Property` AST element has a field
 * called `renameable` which dicatates whether to use a `NamingStrategy`
 * during tokenization in `SqlIdiom` (and other idioms) or not. Since this property
 * only does things after Normalization, it should be completely transparent to
 * beta reduction (all AST Opinion's have the same behavior).
 * This is why we need to automatically set the `renameable` field to
 * a pre-defined value every time `Property` is looked up. This is
 * done via the `Ast.neutralize` method.
