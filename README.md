This branch content is here to migrate the documentation from the `getquill.io` website to
the `https://zio.dev/zio-quill/` website.

The content of `index.html` redirects the user who's going to `getquill.io` to the new doc website.

Found how to do this thanks to this blog post: https://dev.to/steveblue/setup-a-redirect-on-github-pages-1ok7
