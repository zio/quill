/**
 * The challenge with appeneding infixes (that have not been used but are still needed)
 * back into the query, is that they could be inside of tuples/case-classes that have already
 * been selected, or inside of sibling elements which have been selected.
 * Take for instance a query that looks like this:
 * <pre><code>
 *   query[Person].map(p => (p.name, (p.id, infix"foo(\${p.other})".as[Int]))).map(p => (p._1, p._2._1))
 * </code></pre>
 * In this situation, `p.id` which is the sibling of the non-selected infix has been selected
 * via `p._2._1` (whose select-order is List(1,0) to represent 1st element in 2nd tuple.
 * We need to add it's sibling infix.
 *
 * Or take the following situation:
 * <pre><code>
 *   query[Person].map(p => (p.name, (p.id, infix"foo(\${p.other})".as[Int]))).map(p => (p._1, p._2))
 * </code></pre>
 * In this case, we have selected the entire 2nd element including the infix. We need to know that
 * `P._2._2` does not need to be selected since `p._2` was.
 *
 * In order to do these things, we use the `order` property from `OrderedSelect` in order to see
 * which sub-sub-...-element has been selected. If `p._2` (that has order `List(1)`)
 * has been selected, we know that any infixes inside of it e.g. `p._2._1` (ordering `List(1,0)`)
 * does not need to be.
