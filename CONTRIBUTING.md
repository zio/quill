# How to Contribute

Instructions on how to contribute to Quill project.

## Building the project using Docker

The only dependency you need to build Quill locally is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
Instructions on how to install Docker can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

If you are running Linux, you should also install Docker Compose separately, as described
[here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

After installing Docker and Docker Compose you have to setup databases:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm setup
```

When running the first time docker will also build images. To skip building you can pull images from Docker Hub before executing the above setup command:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```


After that you are ready to build and test the project.

```bash
docker-compose run --rm sbt sbt test
```

## Building Scala.js targets

The Scala.js targets are disabled by default, use `sbt "project quill-with-js"` to enable them.
The CI build also sets this `project quill-with-js` to force the Scala.js compilation.

## Changing database schema

If any file that creates a database schema was changed then you have to setup the databases again:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose run --rm setup
```

## Changing docker configuration

If `build/Dockerfile-sbt`, `build/Dockerfile-setup`, `docker-compose.yml` or any file used by them was changed then you have to rebuild docker images and to setup the databases again:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose run --rm setup
```

## Tests

### Running tests

Run all tests:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm sbt sbt test
```

Run specific test:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm sbt sbt "test-only io.getquill.context.sql.SqlQuerySpec"
```

Run all tests in specific sub-project:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm sbt sbt "project quill-async" test
```

Run specific test in specific sub-project:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm sbt sbt "project quill-sqlJVM" "test-only io.getquill.context.sql.SqlQuerySpec"
```

### Debugging tests
1. Run sbt in interactive mode with docker container ports mapped to the host: 
```bash
docker-compose run --service-ports --rm sbt
```

2. Attach debugger to port 15005 of your docker host. In IntelliJ IDEA you should create Remote Run/Debug Configuration, 
change it port to 15005.
3. In sbt command line run tests with `test` or test specific spec by passing full name to `test-only`:
```bash
> test-only io.getquill.context.sql.SqlQuerySpec
```

## Pull Request

In order to contribute to the project, just do as follows:

1. Fork the project
2. Build it locally
3. Code
4. Compile (file will be formatted)
5. Run the tests through `docker-compose run sbt sbt test`
6. If everything is ok, commit and push to your fork
7. Create a Pull Request, we'll be glad to review it

## File Formatting 

[Scalariform](http://mdr.github.io/scalariform/) is used as file formatting tool in this project.
Every time you compile the project in sbt, file formatting will be triggered.

## Building locally using Docker only for databases

To restart your database service with database ports exposed to your host machine run:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose run --rm --service-ports setup
```

After that we need to set some environment variables in order to run `sbt` locally.

```bash
export CASSANDRA_HOST=<docker host address>
export CASSANDRA_PORT=19042
export MYSQL_HOST=<docker host address>
export MYSQL_PORT=13306
export POSTGRES_HOST=<docker host address>
export POSTGRES_PORT=15432
```

If you run docker locally then usually docker host address is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

Finally, you can use `sbt` locally.
